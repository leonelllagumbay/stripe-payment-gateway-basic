This is a sample template on how to integrate Stripe with Strapi

### Prerequisite:

 - https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli example: stripe listen
   --forward-to [http://localhost:1337/webhook](http://localhost:1337/webhook)
 
 - [https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard]
 - (https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard)
  

 -  [https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/integration-builder](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/integration-builder)

### Create Stripe dev account 

 - https://dashboard.stripe.com/login

### Get Stripe API Credentials

 - Publishable Key
 - Signing Secret 
 - Secret Key

### Frontend code
Follow the codes from Homepage

### Backend code
Follow the routes, controllers, and services codes
Set environment variables SIGNING_SECRET and SECRET_KEY in .env in the root Strapi folder.
Also the STRIPE_SUCCESS_REDIRECT_URL and STRIPE_CANCEL_REDIRECT_URL.

### Note
koa-body/unparsed.js must be enabled under Strapi's config/middleware file

    settings: {
      parser: {
        enabled:  true,
        multipart:  true,
        includeUnparsed:  true,
      },
    },

koa-body/unparsed.js must also be installed to parse the Stripes raw  payload.

Then run yarn strapi build then yarn develop.
Make this plugin's createsession and webhook API to be public in Strapi Settings -> Users and Permissions -> Roles -> Public

That's it. Just click the
